* Known issue

  You need to start the program first, wait for all the page elements to load, after that, the program will work properly.

  That is, the first time you run the program, you need to press the shortcut key twice.The first time is to start the program, after the page loaded, then press the shortcut again to trigger the translation action.

* How to use

** install dependencies

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev xsel xdotool
   #+END_SRC

+ xsel
  clipboard needs it

+ xdotool
  active this app when do translating work in other apps

** build
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     cd /path/to/someDir
     git clone https://github.com/kumakichi/Deepl-linux.git
     cd Deepl-linux
     make
   #+END_SRC

** modify loader.sh if you need to

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     WIDTH=800 # window width
     HEIGHT=600 # window height
   #+END_SRC

** add system shortcut

   in ubuntu

   *settings* => *keyboard shortcut* => *Add Custom Shortcut*

   add this command: */path/to/someDir/Deepl-linux/loader.sh*
   
   I set this command with shortcut *Ctrl-Alt-D*

** use it

   select text in any application, press *Ctrl+c* to copy selected content into clipboard, then press the shortcut you just defined for *loader.sh*, here I press *Ctrl-Alt-D*
